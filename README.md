Socket sdk for javascript, library create template base on [typescript-library-starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter)

### Usage

```bash
npm install socket-sdk
```

#### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import SocketClient from 'socket-sdk';
```

Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:

```javascript
import SocketClient from 'socket-sdk/dist/lib/socket-sdk';
```

### API

[API Document](http://fex.1ziton.com/socket-sdk/)

### NPM scripts

- `npm t`: Run test suite
- `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode
- `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
- `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate coverage
- `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs
- `npm run lint`: Lints code
- `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style ([husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) will tell you to use it if you haven't :wink:)

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

### Git Hooks

There is already set a `precommit` hook for formatting your code with Prettier :nail_care:

By default, there are two disabled git hooks. They're set up when you run the `npm run semantic-release-prepare` script. They make sure:

- You follow a [conventional commit message](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
- Your build is not going to fail in [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) (or your CI server), since it's runned locally before `git push`

This makes more sense in combination with [automatic releases](#automatic-releases)

### FAQ

#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```
